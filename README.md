## **An Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) project on Airbnb Bookings Analysis.**

## ðŸ“‹ **Problem Statement**

One of the biggest challenges for Airbnb is to maintain positive
customer experience along with having a financially profitable
business model for property owners. How factors are affecting
the price for the Airbnb listing in NYC? What is the overall
location distribution of Airbnb NYC? Which neighbourhood has
a better average price for the Airbnb listing? Our goal is to
build a statistical model to effectively predict the price for the
listings and company can use this model to come up with a
price suggestion for the future listings.

The libraries that are used in this project are:

1. Pandas
2. Matplotlib
3. Seaborn

## **Data Pipeline**

**Data Understanding:** This step includes a general walk through over the dataset knowing the dimensions of the dataset, datatype, different features, Checking for missing values.

**Data Processing:** At this stage i have dropped columns that had some null value and also were less relevant to the scope of our analysis, this is done to keep our data set small and concise so that handling would be easy,looked forward to the outliers to keep our data free from any anomaly and hence found the price column to skewed towards the right and for that purpose we used median values where the analysis is done on the basis of price.

**Exploratory Data Analysis:** EDA or Exploratory Data Analysis is the critical process of performing the initial investigation on the data. So, through this we have observed certain trends and dependencies and also drawn certain conclusions from the dataset that will be useful for further processing.

## **Conclusions**

1. This Airbnb (NYC 2019) Dataset For The Year 2019 Appeared to be a very rich Dataset with a variety of coloumns that allowed us to do deep data exploration.

2. First,we have found hosts that take good advantage of the Airbnb platform and provide the most listing.Thus,we found that our top host (Sonder) has 327 listings.

3. On the basis of reviews the neighbourhood group,Queens has maximum number of reviews followed by others.so,if there are more number of Reviews for particular Neighbourhood group that means that place is a tourist place.

4. Manhattan is the busiest neighbourhood place as the minimum night spend is maximum compared to others.so,if people are not staying more then one night means they are travellers.

5. From the above analysis we can conclude that most of the people choose entire home apartment as their first choice.
